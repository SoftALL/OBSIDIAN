## Project Overview

**OBSIDIAN** is a Streamlit-based application for classifying Arabic tweets or short texts using a fine-tuned **AraBERT** model.

The app supports:
- **Single-text classification**
- **Batch classification** from CSV/XLSX files
- **Prediction confidence display**
- **Class probability visualization**
- **Batch result download as CSV**

This project turns Abdullah's notebook-based Colab work into a cleaner, organized application that can be reviewed, tested, and deployed more easily.

The model classifies Arabic text into **5 categories**:
- **Threat**
- **Violence**
- **Distress**
- **Complaint**
- **Neutral**

## Objective

The goal of this project is to:
- convert the original Colab prototype into a clean GitHub project
- provide a user-friendly Streamlit interface
- support both single-text and batch prediction workflows
- separate code, model hosting, and deployment more clearly
- make the project easier to test, demonstrate, and hand off

## Current Architecture

The current deployed-style setup is:

- **GitHub** hosts the application code
- **Hugging Face** hosts the fine-tuned model files
- **Streamlit** runs the user interface
- The app loads the model from the Hugging Face model repo:
  - `SoftALL/OBSIDIAN`

This means the application no longer depends on a local `model.safetensors` file inside the GitHub repository.

## Repositories and Hosting

### GitHub repository
- Organization: **SoftALL**
- Repository: **OBSIDIAN**

### Hugging Face model repository
- Organization: **SoftALL**
- Model repository: **OBSIDIAN**

The Hugging Face model repo is used to host the model assets required for inference.

## Label Definitions

### Threat
Text that includes direct or indirect threats, intimidation, or intent to cause harm.

**Example:**  
`سأقتلك إذا رأيتك مرة أخرى`

### Violence
Text describing physical aggression, assault, attack, or violent incidents.

**Example:**  
`قاموا بضرب الرجل في الشارع بعنف شديد`

### Distress
Text expressing fear, panic, emotional suffering, helplessness, or need for help.

**Example:**  
`أنا خائف جدًا ولا أعرف ماذا أفعل، أحتاج مساعدة`

### Complaint
Text expressing dissatisfaction, frustration, criticism, or reporting a service or product issue.

**Example:**  
`الخدمة سيئة جدًا والتطبيق يتعطل كل مرة`

### Neutral
Text that does not strongly indicate threat, violence, distress, or complaint.

**Example:**  
`الجو اليوم معتدل والناس في الحديقة`

## Model Hosting Details

The fine-tuned model is hosted on Hugging Face in:

- `SoftALL/OBSIDIAN`

The Hugging Face model repo contains the following model assets:
- `config.json`
- `model.safetensors`
- `tokenizer.json`
- `tokenizer_config.json`

Important notes:
- the large `model.safetensors` file is **not tracked** inside the GitHub application repo
- the application loads the model from Hugging Face using Transformers `from_pretrained()`
- the local `model/` folder in this repo only keeps small configuration/tokenizer files for project organization and reference

## Installation

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SoftALL/OBSIDIAN.git
cd OBSIDIAN
```

### 2. Create and activate a virtual environment

#### macOS / Linux
```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

#### Windows
```bash
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## How to Run Locally

Run the Streamlit app with:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

Then open the local URL shown in the terminal, usually:

```text
http://localhost:8501
```

### Important
Since the app loads the model from Hugging Face, you need:
- an internet connection on first run
- enough time for the model to download/cache the first time

After the model is cached, later runs are usually faster on the same machine.

## How to Use the App

### Single Text Mode

1. Open the **Single Text** tab
2. Enter one Arabic sentence or tweet
3. Click **Predict**
4. Review:
   - predicted label
   - confidence score
   - probability chart
   - class probability table

#### Example inputs

**Threat**  
`سأقتلك إذا رأيتك مرة أخرى`

**Violence**  
`قاموا بضرب الرجل في الشارع بعنف شديد`

**Distress**  
`أنا خائف جدًا ولا أعرف ماذا أفعل، أحتاج مساعدة`

**Complaint**  
`الخدمة سيئة جدًا والتطبيق يتعطل كل مرة`

**Neutral**  
`الجو اليوم معتدل والناس في الحديقة`

### Batch Upload Mode

1. Open the **Batch Upload** tab
2. Upload a CSV or XLSX file
3. Select the text column to classify
4. Click **Run Batch Prediction**
5. Review:
   - uploaded data preview
   - selected text column preview
   - progress indicator
   - classified result preview
   - predicted label distribution chart
6. Download the full output as CSV

#### Supported text column names

The app detects these names case-insensitively:
- `cleaned_text`
- `text`
- `tweet`
- `tweet_text`
- `content`

So columns like `Text` and `text` are both supported.

## Sample Test File

A small sample file is included for quick testing:

```text
data_samples/sample_test.csv
```

This file can be used directly in the **Batch Upload** tab.

## Preprocessing and Inference Notes

The app uses lightweight preprocessing to stay consistent with the original notebook workflow and trained model assumptions.

Current preprocessing includes:
- handling missing values
- converting values to strings
- trimming whitespace
- collapsing repeated spaces

The app avoids aggressive extra cleaning so the text stays closer to the model's expected input style.

Inference is aligned with the trained setup by using:
- the uploaded Hugging Face model repo
- `max_length=128`

## Deployment Notes

The project has been prepared for Streamlit deployment using:
- public GitHub code under **SoftALL/OBSIDIAN**
- public Hugging Face model hosting under **SoftALL/OBSIDIAN**

This setup is convenient for demos, but there are still tradeoffs:
- the first cold start can be slow
- the model is relatively large
- a more efficient long-term architecture would separate the inference backend from the Streamlit frontend

## Current Limitations

- the Hugging Face model file is large, so first-time startup can take time
- batch prediction currently runs row by row, so large files may take noticeable time
- preview tables intentionally show only a subset of rows:
  - uploaded data preview: first 10 rows
  - selected text preview: first 5 rows
  - results preview: first 20 rows
- some class boundaries may overlap in difficult examples, especially between **Threat** and **Distress**
- the current architecture is suitable for demos, but not the most efficient production architecture

## Original Notebook Context

The original notebooks were used as reference material for:
- training workflow
- dataset usage
- model configuration
- prototype inference logic

This repository is the cleaned application layer built from that earlier notebook-based work.

## Status

Current status:
- GitHub repo organized under **SoftALL**
- Hugging Face model repo created under **SoftALL**
- model files uploaded successfully
- Streamlit app works locally
- single-text prediction works
- batch prediction works
- sample test file included
- project branding assets added

## Future Improvements

Possible next improvements:
- split the system into **frontend + inference API**
- keep the model loaded in a backend service instead of the Streamlit process
- improve batch inference speed
- add richer analytics to batch mode
- add deployment screenshots and final public demo link
- optimize cold-start performance for public deployment
